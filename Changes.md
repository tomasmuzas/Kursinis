# Controllers

* Base classes
    * `Controller: ApiController` -> `Controller: ControllerBase`
    * `using System.Web.Http;` -> `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;`
* Generic return types   
    * `IHttpActionResult` -> `IActionResult` or `ActionResult<T>`
    * `Ok()` stays the same
* HTTP Attributes
    * `FromUri` -> `FromQuery`
    * `FromBody` stays the same

# Database Code

* Database context constructor:
    * There is no empty constructor anymore.
        * Was
            ```csharp
            public class DatabaseContextName : DbContext{
                public DatabaseContextName()
                    : base("ConnectionString")
                {

                }
            }

            ```
        * Now
            ```csharp
            public class DatabaseContextName : DbContext{
                public DatabaseContextName(DbContextOptions<DatabaseContext> options)
                    : base(options)
                {

                }
            }
            ```
            Thus dependency Injection is used `services.AddDbContext<DatabaseContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer("ConnectionString"))`
    * Namespace `using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;` is required to use LINQ's `IQueryable` and `DbContext`

# Database Schema

* Primary Key Naming `PK_dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements` -> `PK_InvestmentAgreements`
* Foreign Key Naming `FK_dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements_dbo.Profiles_Profile_Id` -> `FK_InvestmentAgreements_Profiles_DbProfileId`
* Index Naming `IX_Product_Id` -> `IX_InvestmentAgreements_ProductId`
* Id Column Naming `DbProfile_Id` -> `DbProfileId`

Migration script:

```sql
USE master;  
GO
--Indexes
EXEC sp_rename N'dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements.IX_DbProfile_Id',N'IX_InvestmentAgreements_DbProfileId', N'INDEX';
EXEC sp_rename N'dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements.IX_DbProfile_Id',N'IX_InvestmentAgreements_DbProfileId', N'INDEX';

--Primary Keys
EXEC sp_rename N'[dbo].[DbInvestmentAgreements].[PK_dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements]',N'PK_InvestmentAgreements';
EXEC sp_rename N'[dbo].[DbProducts].[PK_dbo.DbProducts]',N'PK_DbProducts';
EXEC sp_rename N'[dbo].[DbProfiles].[PK_dbo.DbProfiles]',N'PK_DbProfiles';

--Foreign Keys
EXEC sp_rename N'[dbo].[FK_dbo.DbInvestmentAgreements_dbo.Profiles_Profile_Id]',N'FK_InvestmentAgreements_Profiles_DbProfileId';

-- Columns
EXEC sp_rename N'[dbo].[DbInvestmentAgreements].[DbProfile_Id]',N'DbProfileId', N'COLUMN';

GO  
```

This is not an end though. You have to migrate only once.

There are several options to do that:
* One we have implemented at our systems. Have a conditional script which checks whether EF Framework `__Migrations` table has a special entry (any fictional entry). If no, then insert one and migrate it. If there are no tables, create another script to create database from scratch. This script can be auto generated by many tools. Scripts are executed and injected during initial migration.

* Have conditional renaming of indexes, FKs and PKs, which will run all the time when applying migrations.

**After both ways you have to compare database schemas to ensure that they match** (most likely with some degree of tolerance, or even human review which allows to neglect insignificant changes)

# Migrations

* Migration blob is not saved anymore. Only migration ID is saved (which is migration name)
